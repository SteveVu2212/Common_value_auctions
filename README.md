# Introduction

It is a Stan-version analysis of signal purchasing behavior in a common value auction experiment. It is also an extension to the simulation of [multi agent learning in common value auctions](https://github.com/SteveVu2212/Multi-Agent-Learning-in-Common-Value-Auctions).

Recall that in a common value auction, the value of the reward is the same for every buyers who are able to acquire private information by purchasing up to 5 signals about how much the prize is. The project focuses on analyzing the signal purchasing behavior of each subject in the experiment.

The models are written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org), a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling.

# Disclaimer

Here is the most important. The experiment was conducted at Economic Science Institute (ESI) at Chapman Univerisity and the data belongs to ESI.
